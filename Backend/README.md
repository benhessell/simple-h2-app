# Back End for SimpleH2App

### Set Up
Right click build.gradle and click 'import gradle modules' if available.
Run ./gradlew bootRun, on first time will take longer as it downloads dependencies.

### Scripts
- ./gradlew bootRun -> starts local server
- ./gradlew build -> builds front end

### TroubleShoot

- If IntelliJ is struggling to recognise core dependencies: file -> invalidated caches / Restart
